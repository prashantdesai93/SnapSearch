# SnapSearch

SnapSearch is a straightforward and user-friendly image search tool created with React. Using a word or phrase, you may search for photographs on Flickr using SnapSearch, and then use a responsive thumbnail grid to peruse the results. In addition to offering a modal view to show a selected image in full size, SnapSearch includes pagination to manage handling big numbers of images. Environment variables are used by SnapSearch to protect your Flickr API key in accordance with best practices. Discover the power of straightforward, intuitive image search by giving SnapSearch a try now.

This app uses photos search API from flickr : https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html
